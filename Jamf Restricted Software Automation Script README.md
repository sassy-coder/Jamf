![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a6ba08b-f99f-4bdc-a0a9-3866456020c4)

**Overview**
This Powershell script automates the identification and restriction of unauthorized software in a Jamf Pro environment. It analyzes applications installed on managed devices, compares them to a whitelist, and restricts unauthorized applications exceeding a specified usage threshold. Additionally, it generates a log report and sends an email summary with details of restricted applications.

**Features**
Automated Restricted Software Management
Automatically identifies and restricts software not in the whitelist.

**Whitelist Support**
Skip restriction for applications listed in the whitelist.

**Threshold-Based Restriction**
Only restrict applications with a usage count exceeding 5.

**Dual Mode Operation**
Testing Mode: Simulates restrictions without making changes to Jamf.
Live Mode: Applies restrictions to Jamf.
Reporting
Generates a log file (.csv) detailing restricted applications.

**Email Notifications**
Sends an email summary of restricted applications, including an HTML table, log attachment, and optional image.

**Prerequisites**
Jamf Pro API Credentials
Ensure you have valid Jamf API credentials (username/password or client ID/secret).

**Email Configuration**

SMTP server details.
Email credentials for sending notifications.
Inventory Settings in Jamf Pro
Ensure that the home directory is scanned during inventory check-ins to capture user-installed applications.

Update $recipients with the email addresses for notifications.
Update the $whitelist array with applications that should not be restricted.
